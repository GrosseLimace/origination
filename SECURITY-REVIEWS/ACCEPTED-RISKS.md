# Accepted Security Risks — Grain Originator Portal (Origination)

This document records security findings that have been reviewed and **formally accepted** as
residual risk, with rationale and compensating controls. It is the canonical "security model"
record for intentional deviations from least-privilege defaults. Scanners may continue to flag
these patterns; triage against the AR-IDs below before re-opening.

| ID | Title | Severity | CWE | Status | Accepted | Re-review by |

## AR-01 — Collaborative edit/delete of shared producer data

**Finding** (scan 2026-06-22; CWE-639 / OWASP A01:2021 Broken Access Control). The following
mutation endpoints perform no per-record ownership or trade-unit authorization check — any
authenticated user may modify or delete any record by enumerating its ID:

- `NotesController` — `PUT /api/notes/{id}`, `PUT /api/notes/{id}/toggle-pin`, `DELETE /api/notes/{id}`
- `PlantingIntentionsController` — `PUT /api/plantingintentions/{id}`, `DELETE /api/plantingintentions/{id}`
- `ProducerDetailsController` — `PUT/DELETE /api/producerdetails/customer/{customerId}`

### Decision: Accepted

**Rationale.** The portal is an internal tool for Scoular grain originators. Producer notes,
planting intentions, and producer details are **shared, collaborative records about a producer** —
not personal data owned by an individual rep. Originators cover for one another and work the same
producers across trade units, so **trade units are a UX filter, not an access boundary** (as
documented inline in each controller). Enforcing per-author edit/delete would break legitimate
hand-off and coverage workflows and contradicts the product's collaboration model.

**Scope / blast radius.**
- All callers are **authenticated Scoular employees** — Azure AD JWT is required on every endpoint; no anonymous access.
- Limited to producer notes / planting intentions / producer details. No financial, contract, or system-of-record data is mutated (CTRM/ODS are read-only upstream).
- Read access is already intentionally broad for the same collaboration reasons.

**Compensating controls.**
- **Authentication** on every endpoint (Azure AD bearer token).
- **Attribution & audit** — every mutation emits a structured `AUDIT_UPDATE` / `AUDIT_DELETE` log entry (record id + actor identity via `SecurityAuditMiddleware` / correlation id), and `CreatedBy` / `ModifiedBy` columns capture the acting user where present, so changes are attributable and reconstructable from history.
- Changes are reversible (records can be re-entered; upstream sources of record are unaffected).

**Residual risk.** A malicious or careless authenticated employee could alter or delete another
rep's note/intention/detail. Mitigated by full attribution (audit trail) and a trusted, internal,
authenticated user population.

**Re-evaluate if:** the application is exposed to external or untrusted users, or these records
gain regulatory/financial significance that would require per-record ownership enforcement.

# Accepted Security Risks — Grain Originator Portal (Origination)

This document records security findings that have been reviewed and **formally accepted** as
residual risk, with rationale and compensating controls. It is the canonical "security model"
record for intentional deviations from least-privilege defaults. Scanners may continue to flag
these patterns; triage against the AR-IDs below before re-opening.

## AR-01 — Collaborative edit/delete of shared producer data

**Finding** (scan 2026-06-22; CWE-639 / OWASP A01:2021 Broken Access Control). The following
mutation endpoints perform no per-record ownership or trade-unit authorization check — any
authenticated user may modify or delete any record by enumerating its ID:

- `NotesController` — `PUT /api/notes/{id}`, `PUT /api/notes/{id}/toggle-pin`, `DELETE /api/notes/{id}`
- `PlantingIntentionsController` — `PUT /api/plantingintentions/{id}`, `DELETE /api/plantingintentions/{id}`
- `ProducerDetailsController` — `PUT/DELETE /api/producerdetails/customer/{customerId}`
- `DashboardPlantingEstimatesController` — `DELETE /api/dashboardplantingestimates/actualharvest/{id}` (added per Codex scan 2026-06-29). The controller's `[EnforceTradeUnitAccess]` filter validates the trade-unit-keyed reads and upserts, but the delete-by-id route carries no trade-unit parameter to check. Actual-harvest rows are shared dashboard data of the same nature as the records above, so this delete is **intentionally left matching the shared-record delete model** rather than made stricter than every other delete in the app.

### Decision: Accepted

**Rationale.** The portal is an internal tool for Scoular grain originators. Producer notes,
planting intentions, and producer details are **shared, collaborative records about a producer** —
not personal data owned by an individual rep. Originators cover for one another and work the same
producers across trade units, so **trade units are a UX filter, not an access boundary** (as
documented inline in each controller). Enforcing per-author edit/delete would break legitimate
hand-off and coverage workflows and contradicts the product's collaboration model.

**Scope / blast radius.**
- All callers are **authenticated Scoular employees** — Azure AD JWT is required on every endpoint; no anonymous access.
- Limited to producer notes / planting intentions / producer details. No financial, contract, or system-of-record data is mutated (CTRM/ODS are read-only upstream).
- Read access is already intentionally broad for the same collaboration reasons.

**Compensating controls.**
- **Authentication** on every endpoint (Azure AD bearer token).
- **Attribution & audit** — every mutation emits a structured `AUDIT_UPDATE` / `AUDIT_DELETE` log entry (record id + actor identity via `SecurityAuditMiddleware` / correlation id), and `CreatedBy` / `ModifiedBy` columns capture the acting user where present, so changes are attributable and reconstructable from history.
- Changes are reversible (records can be re-entered; upstream sources of record are unaffected).

**Residual risk.** A malicious or careless authenticated employee could alter or delete another
rep's note/intention/detail. Mitigated by full attribution (audit trail) and a trusted, internal,
authenticated user population.

**Re-evaluate if:** the application is exposed to external or untrusted users, or these records
gain regulatory/financial significance that would require per-record ownership enforcement.

## AR-02 — Customer-scoped reads not restricted by trade-unit entitlement

**Finding** (scan 2026-06-23; HIGH; CWE-639 / CWE-284 Broken Access Control). Customer-scoped read
endpoints accept a client-supplied identifier and return the producer's data without an object-level
authorization check (no `ValidateCustomerAccessAsync` or equivalent) — they require only a valid
bearer token. An authenticated user who learns/guesses another producer's id or ScoularId can read
that producer's profile and related data outside their entitled trade units:

- `GET /api/customers/{id}`, `GET /api/customers/by-source/{sourceId}`
- `GET /api/contracts/customer/{customerId}`
- `GET /api/tickets/customer/{customerId}`
- `GET /api/notes/customer/{customerId}`
- `GET /api/plantingintentions/customer/{customerId}`

### Decision: Accepted

**Rationale.** Same model as AR-01 — this is an internal collaboration tool for authenticated Scoular
originators, and **trade units are a UX filter, not an access boundary**. Reps cover for one another
and routinely work producers across trade units; the per-customer read endpoints are intentionally
open so a rep can pull up any producer. Trade-unit entitlement is applied to *list/search* views as a
relevance default, not as a per-record security boundary. Enforcing object-level authz here would
break legitimate cross-trade-unit workflows (and contradicts AR-01).

**Scope / compensating controls.** Read-only; authenticated Scoular employees only (Azure AD JWT on
every endpoint); no financial/system-of-record mutation (CTRM/ODS are read-only upstream); access is
attributable via request logging/correlation id. Server still derives authoritative customer fields
from the persisted record rather than trusting client-supplied display values where it matters.

**Residual risk.** A curious/malicious authenticated employee could read a producer outside their
trade units by id. Mitigated by the trusted internal user population and audit logging.

**Re-evaluate if:** the app is exposed to external/untrusted users, or producer data gains
regulatory/financial sensitivity requiring per-record authorization. The mechanism already exists
(`UserEntitlementService.ValidateCustomerAccessAsync`) and could be wired onto these routes if the
access model changes.

## AR-03 — Rep-driven trade-unit assignment

**Finding** (scan 2026-06-23; HIGH; CWE-284 / CWE-639). `PUT /api/customers/{id}/trade-units` and
`DELETE /api/customers/{id}/trade-units/{tradeUnit}` let any authenticated user change a producer's
`dbo.CustomerTradeUnit` membership — the data that drives entitlement scoping — with no admin check
and no validation that the requested trade units are permitted for the caller. In principle a user
could onboard a producer into their own trade unit (then see that producer via entitlement-scoped
views) or remove legitimate memberships.

### Decision: Accepted

**Rationale.** This is the **intended rep-driven producer-onboarding flow** (the "New Customer Trade
Units" feature): originators onboard producers that exist in CTRM but have no contract/ticket by
assigning trade units. Because trade units are a UX filter and not an access boundary (AR-01/AR-02),
"onboard a producer into my trade unit" is a normal, expected rep action, not a privilege escalation
in this model. All actors are trusted, authenticated Scoular employees.

**Scope / compensating controls.** Authenticated Scoular employees only; mutations are attributable
(audit logging + `CreatedBy`/`ModifiedBy`/`IsActive` soft-delete on `CustomerTradeUnit`, so changes
are reversible and traceable); no source-of-record (CTRM/ODS) data is altered.

**Residual risk.** A malicious employee could broaden their own visibility or disrupt another rep's
producer memberships. Mitigated by attribution (audit trail), soft-delete reversibility, and the
trusted internal population.

**Re-evaluate if:** onboarding moves to a restricted role, the app is exposed to external/untrusted
users, or trade-unit membership becomes a hard security boundary. At that point, gate these endpoints
to an admin/onboarding role and validate requested trade units against the caller's entitlements.

## AR-04 — ODS onboarding search exposes producer-master PII

**Finding** (scan 2026-06-23; HIGH; CWE-284 / CWE-200). `GET /api/customers/search-ods` returns
onboarding candidates from the CTRM producer master (`base.vw_CurrentCustomers`) to any authenticated
caller with no trade-unit or role scoping. Results include producer contact PII (address, phone,
email) and a broad term (even a single letter) can enumerate up to 50 not-yet-onboarded producers
per request, outside the caller's trade units.

### Decision: Accepted

**Rationale.** This endpoint is the **rep onboarding search** (the home-page fallback for the "New
Customer Trade Units" flow, AR-03). It is *intentionally* unscoped: these producers have no trade
unit yet, so trade-unit scoping is impossible and a rep must be able to search the whole producer
master to find someone to onboard. All callers are trusted, authenticated Scoular employees, and the
data originates from CTRM (the system of record), which staff already access. A `>= 3` character
minimum and `TOP 50` bound the query; results exclude already-onboarded producers.

**Scope / compensating controls.** Authenticated Scoular employees only (Azure AD JWT); read-only;
no source-of-record mutation; minimum search length + 50-row cap limit bulk extraction; the data is
internal producer contact info, not regulated/financial.

**Residual risk.** An authenticated employee could enumerate producer-master contact PII outside
their trade units. Mitigated by the trusted internal population and the search-length / row caps.

**Re-evaluate if:** the app is exposed to external/untrusted users, or producer contact PII becomes
regulated. At that point, trim `search-ods` to non-sensitive identification fields (name, ScoularId,
city/state) and fetch full contact detail only for a producer the rep actually onboards.

## AR-05 — Bid-sheet location/elevator reads unscoped across trade units

**Finding** (scan 2026-06-23; HIGH; CWE-284). `GET /api/bidsheet/locations` and
`GET /api/bidsheet/elevators` become unscoped when the `tradeUnitCode` query parameter is omitted:
`BidSheetController` only validates entitlements when the parameter is present, and the service then
returns every location (with its full `Bids` collection) / every elevator across all trade units. Any
authenticated user can read bid-sheet data outside their assigned trade units by omitting the filter.

### Decision: Accepted

**Rationale.** Cross-trade-unit *visibility* of bid-sheet locations and bids is **intended** — the
frontend deliberately loads all locations for the map view, and reps benefit from seeing the wider
bid picture. The authorization boundary that matters for bid sheets is **mutation**, and that is
enforced: every write path validates the caller's trade-unit entitlement —
`POST/PUT/DELETE /locations`, `DELETE /locations/{id}/bids/...`, `POST /bids/bulk`, and the
`cropyears` / `commodities` / `bidmonths` / `location-order` endpoints all call
`ValidateTradeUnitsOrThrowAsync`. A user can only **edit** trade units they are entitled to; the
broad read is a deliberate product decision, not financial/PII data.

**Scope / compensating controls.** Authenticated Scoular employees only; the unscoped path is
**read-only**; all bid-sheet mutations are entitlement-gated; data is internal bid info (no PII).

**Residual risk.** An employee can read bid-sheet locations/bids outside their trade units. Accepted
as intended visibility.

**Re-evaluate if:** bid pricing becomes competitively sensitive *between* trade units such that a
read boundary is required. At that point, scope the omitted-parameter path to the caller's allowed
trade units (derive server-side via `IUserEntitlementService`) instead of returning all.

## AR-06 — Production SQL hostnames / database names in source control

**Finding** (scan 2026-06-23; LOW; CWE-200 / OWASP A05:2021 Security Misconfiguration).
`appsettings.Production.json` (and the equivalent per-env files + `deploy-prod.yml`) commit the
production Azure SQL server hostname (`azrscosqlp01.database.windows.net`) and database names
(`ODS`, `Origination`, `Entitlements`) to the repository. This discloses the production
infrastructure naming convention and SQL endpoints to anyone with repo access.

### Decision: Accepted (deferred to go-live)

**Rationale.** **No credentials are exposed** — every connection string uses
`Authentication=Active Directory Default` (managed identity), so there is no password, key, or
connection secret in the file. What remains is non-secret infrastructure metadata (hostname + db
names). The Azure SQL server already enforces its own authentication and network controls, so
knowing the endpoint does not by itself grant access. The repository is private to the Scoular
`IT` org. Moving these to Key Vault has a **hard ops prerequisite** (the `ConnectionStrings--*`
secrets must exist in each environment's Key Vault *before* the file values are removed, or
startup breaks), which is appropriately sequenced with the existing go-live TODO already recorded
inline in the file.

**Scope / compensating controls.** No secrets disclosed (managed-identity auth only); repo is
private to the `IT` org; Azure SQL enforces AAD auth + firewall/private-endpoint network controls
independently of endpoint knowledge; Key Vault is already wired as a config provider in
`Program.cs`, so the migration is a config/ops change, not new code.

**Residual risk.** An actor with repository access learns the production SQL endpoint and database
names — useful only as reconnaissance, not access. Low blast radius given managed-identity auth and
network controls.

**Re-evaluate if / before go-live:** before general availability, create
`ConnectionStrings--ODSConnection`, `--DefaultConnection`, `--OriginationConnection`,
`--EntitlementsConnection` secrets in each environment's Key Vault and remove the
`ConnectionStrings` block from the per-env `appsettings.*.json` (they will then resolve from Key
Vault via the existing provider). This matches the TODO already present in
`appsettings.Production.json`.
